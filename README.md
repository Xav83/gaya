### Gaya

Gaya is a scripting language I made for doing AoC problems in 2023.
The name comes from my favourite cat.

Since its a toy language, its focus is on elegance above anything else. I
wanted something that makes me feel pleasure every time I use it. I hope this
way I can give pleasure to you too.
