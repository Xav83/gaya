# Installing Gaya

You can install Gaya by building it from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/aloussase/gaya
cd gaya
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
```

The process should be straightforward, I do it always when working on the
language ;).
