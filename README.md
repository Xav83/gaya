### Gaya

Gaya is a scripting language I made for solving [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/)
problems in 2023. The name comes from my favourite cat.

Since its a toy language, its focus is on elegance above anything else. I
wanted something that makes me feel pleasure every time I use it. I hope this
way I can give pleasure to you too.

```ocaml
"  Gaya is cool  "
    |> string.trim(_)
    |> string.concat(_, "!")
    |> string.split(_, " ")
```
</p>

#### Documentation

You can read the language documentation [here](./docs/toc.md).

For examples, take a look at the `examples` directory of at the standard
library at `runtime/stdlib.gaya`.

### Feedback & Contributing

Please feel free to open an issue or PR if you think you can make Gaya better!
The only prerequisites for contributing is getting familiar with codebase style
and using a code formatter that respects the project's configuration.
