# Tooling

## Neovim

I use Neovim, so you can find a plugin for it in the project's
[repository](https://github.com/aloussase/gaya). That plugin provides syntax
highlighting and indentation configuration for a more pleasant experience.

I might write an LSP server for Gaya sometime, that sounds like a fun
challenge.

## Other editors

You can open a PR adding support for other editors if you want.
